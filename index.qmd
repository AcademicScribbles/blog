Hello and welcome to my little nook on the internet! I am Evi (she/her) and I love mathematics and teaching.

I am an early career researcher in Mathematics Education with an interest in mathematics teaching and student support. My research focuses on exploring mathematical discourses. I am particularly interested in patterns of communication during discussions about ideas and practices that go *beyond the mathematics of the moment* (i.e., beyond the curriculum).

Outside of work, I find joy in knitting, sewing, and painting â€“ each with varying levels of success but always with a zest for creating something unique and developing new skills along the way.
